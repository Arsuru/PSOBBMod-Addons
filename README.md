# PSOBBMod-Addons
Addons for https://github.com/HybridEidolon/psobbaddonplugin

For easy installation, download the the files and folders inside PSOBBMod and copy them to your PSOBB directory.
Then download the addons you want (the whole directory, not just the files inside) and place them inside PSOBB/imgui/
Note: I modified the location of the addons in the built dinput8.dll provided here, to search for them in ./imgui/Addon-Name-Directory

At the end your psobb folder should look something like this

PSOBB
 |
 +-- bmp
 |
 +-- data
 |
 +-- imgui
 |  |
 |  +-- addon-name
 |  |   |
 |  |   +-- init.lua
 |  |
 |  +-- imgui.ini
 |
 +-- dinput8.dll
 |
 +-- psobb.exe

Otherwise you can go to the link above, and compile it yourself.

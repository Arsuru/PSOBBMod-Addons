### Notes  
[SolyLib](https://github.com/Solybum/PSOBBMod-Addons/tree/master/solylib)  
This addon is required by all my other addons, they contain helper functions shared between different addons.  
If you are developing addons, feel free to use it.  
  
[Theme Editor](https://github.com/Solybum/PSOBBMod-Addons/tree/master/Theme%20Editor)  
Lets you easily edit the custom theme to use with all my addons (and other people's addons that use it too).  
This addon is not required but doesn't hurt to have it there.
